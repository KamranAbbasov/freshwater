      <h1 class="text-center" style="color: #001f3f;">WHO WE ARE</h1>
      <p style="color: #001f3f; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Through a gathering of Anishinaabe, Métis, and Settler women, 
        Anji Inaashkawun came to be. Anji Inaashkawun, or "waves of change" 
        in Anishinaabemowin, emphasizes a much needed approach to understanding 
        and relating to water. We all need clean drinking water; it is something 
        that connects us beyond race, gender, class, and spirituality. Our goal 
        first and foremost is to connect researchers, knowledge keepers, and 
        concerned citizens on how we take care of the water together.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #001f3f;">
        Some members of Anji Inaashkawun have been working for years on projects related to freshwater culture and the blue economy. 
        Others joined us along the way, creating a diverse group of researchers from Indigenous, settler, and international backgrounds, all committed to protecting the health of freshwater.
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: #474e54;">Our mission</h2>
      <p style="color: #001f3f;">Indigenous partnerships and wisdom are integral to freshwater stewardship, bridging connections with Western worldviews to foster a sustainable freshwater strategy grounded in Indigenous ways of knowing. This strategy addresses freshwater stewardship, climate action, and community well-being (including cross-cultural partnerships and evidence-based approaches). 
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: #474e54;">Our vision</h2>
      <p style="color: #001f3f;">We aim to create sustainable, water-conscious communities guided by Indigenous knowledge and community voices to honour water as a living entity and support its health through inclusive partnerships. 
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: #474e54;">Our values</h2>
      <ul>
        <li style="color: #001f3f;">Respect – Ensuring ethical research design at each stage.</li>
        <li style="color: #001f3f;">Commitment – We are guided by care for our communities and an unwavering commitment to building a better future.</li>
        <li style="color: #001f3f;">Resilience – Driving to overcome barriers for what is right.</li>
        <li style="color: #001f3f;">Seven Generations thinking – Acknowledging ancestral wisdom and responsibility to future generations.</li>
        <li style="color: #001f3f;">Reconciliation – Viewing the world from a Westernized lens and an Indigenous lens in the other to establish a cross-cultural balance in valuing Indigenous and colonial residence/perspectives while recognizing the ‘humanness’ of water.</li>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <p>I was born and raised in Sault Ste. Marie, with roots tied to Batchewana First Nation on my mother's side of the family and Wikwemikong on my father's side.</p>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Research Background</h6>
            <p>I graduated from Algoma University with a Bachelor in Business Administration. My research interests center on community-based Indigenous studies, with a focus on storytelling and cultural preservation through media. I'm especially drawn to how film and digital platforms can amplify Indigenous voices and foster local engagement. I'm interested in learning more about qualitative approaches—such as interviews and participatory media—and how visual storytelling might support intergenerational knowledge sharing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Additional Interests</h6>
            <p>Outside of my academic interests, I'm deeply connected to the land and waterways through activities such as fishing, hunting, and photography. These practices not only reflect my personal values but also inform my growing interest in environmental stewardship and data collection. I'm particularly curious about how localized, land-based knowledge—especially through water monitoring and documentation—can contribute to broader ecological understanding and Indigenous-led conservation initiatives.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Strengths</h6>
            <p>I bring a strong foundation in relationship-building, particularly with First Nation communities, rooted in respectful engagement and cultural awareness. I have experience organizing culturally significant events that foster community connection and celebrate Indigenous identities. My strengths include clear and confident communication, clerical precision, and the ability to solve problems with creativity and adaptability. I'm highly organized, detail-oriented, and capable of managing multiple priorities while maintaining a focus on inclusive collaboration and meaningful outcomes.</p>

            <p> I was born and raised in Bakatá (Bogotá), Colombia, on the traditional lands of the Muisca peoples in the heart of the Colombian Andes. I come from a mestizo heritage, rooted in both settler European and Indigenous Latin American ancestry.</p>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Research Background</h6>
            <p> I studied Sociology and became involved in research on territorial peacebuilding, environmental peace, public policy, and participatory action approaches. During my undergraduate studies, most of my research focused on the post-armed conflict context in Colombia and the transitions toward peace. In 2022, I completed an internship on the blue economy and freshwater culture, which led me to focus my academic and personal path on freshwater governance, environmental justice, as well as creative and community-based approaches to resistance and care. Currently, I’m pursuing a Master's Degree in Environment and Geography.</p>

            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Additional Interests</h6>
            <p> I have a deep interest in visual arts, videography, crafting, and history, but I have never had the opportunity to study them formally. I’m always curious and try to learn a little bit of each, and I think that shapes the way I work and the perspectives I bring to a team. I also enjoy many kinds of sports and outdoor activities, especially swimming and hiking, as they help me feel grounded and bring me peace whenever I need it.</p>

            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Strengths</h6>
            <p> I am eager to learn and try new things that can be beneficial for the team. If we don’t have the skill yet, we can learn it!, I’m learning new things every day to be a kind of jack of all trades. I bring methodologies and critical perspectives from the South of the continent, and I strongly believe in interdisciplinarity. I am learning about environmental sciences, mapping, and geography. I am also curious and creative, with solid skills for graphic and creative needs that complement and communicate our work.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">I work for the water because without healthy water, there is no healthy future. When I am surrounded by water, I feel a strong and indescribable connection, and I want everyone, now and in the future, to be able to experience that as well. I believe that the complexity of the climate crisis demands collective action and efforts that come from multiple ways of knowing, latitudes and disciplines.</p>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <p>I come from a small post-Soviet country called Azerbaijan. I was born in a city called Ganja (yes, I know what you're thinking :) but the native spelling is Gəncə). Later, I moved to the capital city, Baku, located along the shores of the Caspian Sea, the largest lake in the world (alas saltwater). This is my third year in Canada and first in Northern Ontario.</p>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Research Background</h6>
            <p>I hold a Master’s in Sustainability from Brock University. My research interests focus on inequalities, specifically, inequalities in income and wealth, and on distributive justice. When I say inequalities, I don’t mean I’m for complete equality. Humans are born with different features and abilities, and these are facts. But what we do with those facts is up to us. Are we going to embrace our differences and learn from each other? Or are we going to let those differences dictate our lives, especially in terms of who owns what? When it comes to research, I like to work with both words and numbers. I know some methods, but not many methods. That’s why I’m always learning, and that’s also why I’m very happy to be part of this team.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Additional Interests</h6>
            <p>I’ve recently started developing some outdoor hobbies. These days, I mostly enjoy solo kayaking and camping. I like them solo because I like the peace, and I enjoy the bit of adrenaline from being out in the woods by myself. I have some boring hobbies as well. The biggest one is chess: I play it, watch tournaments, and follow the news around it. The same goes for soccer. I also like reading. Currently, I’m reading Kafka’s Metamorphosis.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-4">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Strengths</h6>
            <p>I’d say my main strength is my interest in learning. I’m always excited to learn something new, even when I don’t fully understand it yet. I never shy away from the unfamiliar. Some of my skills include academic research and literature review, making sense of both numbers and words, and a bit of coding (still working on it!).</p>
          </div>

          <div class="mb-3">
            <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-primary mb-2">Why do you work for the water?</h6>
            <p class="mb-0">I work for the water because I believe humans are not entitled to destroy it. A few years back, I had this conversation with a friend, and the more I think about it, the more I realize its meaning. Somehow, our conversation came to a point where I claimed that I’m smarter than at least a slug. My friend said we can’t really know. At the time, I thought it was ridiculous. How could I not be smarter than a slug? My friend also talked about this awe-inspiring (well, at least for me!) network mushrooms have in a forest, where they’re all connected to each other. As time passed and it simmered, I understood what that conversation was about. 
              We humans are not better than slugs or any other animals. We are good at being humans, just like slugs are good at being slugs, and mushrooms are good at being mushrooms. None of us is better than another. We are all neighbors coexisting in this world. That’s why I wonder: how can humans feel so entitled to destroy the environment and the water that surround us? We are not entitled, and no one (or nothing) gave us the right to destroy another being’s home.</p>
